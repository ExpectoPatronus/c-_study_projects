# My C++ Study Projects

- [TreeAndHash](./TreeAndHash/) - implementation of in-memory key-value store based on a hash table and self-balancing binary search tree.
- [Containers](./Containers/) - implementation my own library that implements the basic standard C++ container classes (STL): list, vector, queue, set, etc. 
- [MultilayerPerceptron](./MultilayerPerceptron/) - implementation of a basic multilayer perceptron, which can be trained on an open dataset and perform recognition of 28 handwritten letters of the Latin alphabet.
